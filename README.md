## Introduction

This Server code is the final product of computer-networks course assignment, which I took in the 1st semester of my 2nd year at Bar Ilan University.  
I implemeted an HTTP server on top of TCP, which handles requests from client's browsers to see specific files that sits on the server folder.
<br>After request from client & handling from server is complete, the client can see the result in his browser.



üí• Client request to see specific file like HTML, JPG, etc. using his browser.

üí• Server handles the request from the client.

üí• The client can see the result on his browser' screen.


## Implementation

## Installation - How To Run Code
<b>

1. Clone this repo by creating a specific folder in your computer, open terminal in this folder and run this command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/TopazAvraham/HTTP-server-using-TCP-Sockets
    ```
    Alternatively, you can just download all the files from this repo to your computer, and save them all in that specific folder

2. Open ‚Äúterminal‚Äù in this specific folder.<br>
	
3. Run this command in one terminal to run the server code:
	```
    python3 server.py (para1)
    ```
	
	where para1 = port number that the server will listen to.
  <br>
  
5. Open any browser you want: Google Chrome, FireFox, Edge, Safari, etc.
  
6. write in the search bar (url) the following format:
	
    ```
    http://[Server IP]:[Server port][Path]
    ```
  
and enter the server IP, Port, and path accordingly.
	
7. Press enter and enjoy the results.
