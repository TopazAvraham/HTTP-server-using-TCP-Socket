## Introduction

This server code is the product of computer-networks course assignment, which I took in the 1st semester of my 2nd year at BIU university. <br>  
I implemeted an HTTP server on top of TCP, which handles requests from client's browsers to see specific files that sits on the server folder.
<br>After request from client & handling from server is complete, the client can see the result in his browser.



üí• Client request to see specific file like HTML, JPG, etc. using his browser.

üí• Server handles the request from the client.

üí• The client can see the result on his browser' screen.


## Implementation

In the folder of the repository, there is a server code and a files folder. The server functions as a file storage HTTP server which allows clients to coonect, 
and request files that are inside the files folder.

The files folder contains html pages, jpg photos, etc. <br>

If a client requests a file that in not in the files folder, HTTP 404 error will occur. <br>

After running the server code on the terminal with argument that will be the port server, client can connect with this server, <br>
and ask for pages and files 
that are inside the files folder and they will see it in their browser.

## Installation - How To Run Code
<b>

1. Clone this repo by creating a specific folder in your computer, open terminal in this folder and run this command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/TopazAvraham/HTTP-server-using-TCP-Sockets
    ```
    Alternatively, you can just download all the files from this repo to your computer, and save them all in that specific folder

2. Open ‚Äúterminal‚Äù in this specific folder.<br>
	
3. Run this command in one terminal to run the server code:
	```
    python3 server.py (para1)
    ```
	
	where para1 = port number that the server will listen to.
  <br>
  
5. Open any browser you want: Google Chrome, FireFox, Edge, Safari, etc.
  
6. write in the search bar (url) the following format:
	
    ```
    http://[Server IP]:[Server port][Path]
    ```
  
and enter the server IP, Port, and path accordingly.
	
7. Press enter and enjoy the results.
